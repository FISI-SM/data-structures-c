## Programming Examples

1. Write a program to create a linked list and perform insertions and deletions of all cases. Write functions to sort and finally delete the entire list at once.
2. Write a program to create a circular linked list. Perform insertion and deletion at the beginning and end of the list.
3. Write a program to create a doubly linked list and perform insertions and deletions in all cases.
4. Write a program to create a circular doubly linked list and perform insertions and deletions at the beginning and end of the list.
5. Write a program to implement a header linked list.
6. Write a program to store a polynomial using linked list. Also, perform addition and subtraction on two polynomials.
7. Write a program, using an array of pointers to a structure, to read and display the data of students.  
8. Write a program that passes a pointer to a structure to a function.

## Programming Exercises

1. Declare a structure that represents hierarchical information (Student, Roll Number, Name – First, Middle, Last, Sex, Date of Birth – Day, Month, Year, Marks – English, Mathematics, Computer Science).  
2. Define a structure to store the name, an array `marks[]` (3 subjects), and a character grade. Write a program to display the details of the student whose name is entered by the user. Use an array of students.  
3. Modify Q2 to print each student’s average marks and the class average.  
4. Make an array of students (as in Q1) and write a program to display the details of the student with the given Date of Birth.  
5. Write a program to find smallest of three numbers using structures.  
6. Write a program to calculate the distance between the points (6,3) and (2,2).  
7. Write a program to read and display the information about all the employees in a department. Edit the details of the ith employee and redisplay the information.  
8. Write a program to add and subtract height 6'2" and 5'4".  
9. Write a program to add and subtract 10hrs 20mins 50sec and 5hrs 30mins 40sec.  
10. Write a program using structure to check if the current year is leap year or not.  
11. Write a program using pointer to structure to initialize the members of an employee structure. Use functions to print the employee’s information.  
12. Write a program to create a structure `Employee[10]` with: Emp_Id, Name (First, Middle, Last), Address (Area, City, State), Age, Salary, Designation.  
13. Define a structure `date` with day, month, year. Write a program with functions to read data, validate the date, and print it.  
14. Modify Q13 to increment the date (ensuring validity).  
15. Modify Q13 to add a specific number of days to the date.  
16. Define a structure `vector`. Write functions to read, print, add two vectors, and scale by a factor of 10.  
17. Define a structure for a hotel (name, address, grade, number of rooms, room charges). Write functions to print hotels of a given grade, and hotels with charges below a given value.  
18. Write a program to define a union and a structure with the same members. Use `sizeof` to compare their sizes.  
19. Declare a structure `time` (hr, min, sec). Input two times. While start_time < end_time, display “GOOD DAY”.  
20. Declare a structure `fraction` (numerator, denominator). Compare two fractions: return 0 if equal, –1 if first < second, 1 otherwise.  
21. Declare a structure `POINT`. Input coordinates and determine the quadrant.  
22. Write a program to calculate the area of circle, rectangle, or triangle using a structure with a union for dimensions.
