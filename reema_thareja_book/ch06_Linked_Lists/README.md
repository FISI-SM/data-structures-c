## Programming Examples

1. Write a program to create a linked list and perform insertions and deletions of all cases. Write functions to sort and finally delete the entire list at once.
2. Write a program to create a circular linked list. Perform insertion and deletion at the beginning and end of the list.
3. Write a program to create a doubly linked list and perform insertions and deletions in all cases.
4. Write a program to create a circular doubly linked list and perform insertions and deletions at the beginning and end of the list.
5. Write a program to implement a header linked list.
6. Write a program to store a polynomial using linked list. Also, perform addition and subtraction on two polynomials.
